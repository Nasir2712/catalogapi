# catalogapi

CatalogAPI is a product catalog REST API that I developed using nodejs, ExpressJs, mongojs and MongoDB. It is a simple application that I made to enhance my skills in backend and try to learn more about HTTP requests such as POST, PUT and DELETE using mongoDB. The application's data is stored in JSON.
